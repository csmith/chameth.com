<h2>Contact me</h2>

<section class="contact">
    <p>
        If you want to get in touch, please fill out the form below. I'm happy
        to receive feedback, comments, corrections, etc. I try to reply to
        most messages, but make no promises about timeliness!
    </p>

    <p>
        If you need help with something, I'd much prefer you ask publicly
        somewhere first (e.g.: on Stack Overflow, a relevant mailing list,
        forum, etc.). Feel free to then link me to the question. Helping
        people in private doesn't scale!
