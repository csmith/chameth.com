{% figure "right" "Closeup photo of a well-used hammer with a wooden handle" %}

I presume everyone is familiar with the idiom "if all you have is a hammer,
everything looks like a nail". If not, well, there it is. It's generally
used pejoratively about being single-minded, but I think it also gives a glimpse
into something more interesting: mental and perceptual sets.

Before I explain, let me tell you a story about a person who bought a 3D printer[^1].
When they were first thinking about getting one, they weren't sure if it was
worth it. They could print a few board game accessories, but then what? After
they got it, though, a whole new world opened up: everywhere they looked there
were opportunities to improve things by adding 3D printed plastic. Broken
appliances were repaired with 3D printed parts, all sorts of shelves,
organisers, hooks and other things were made. But when they talked about this
to other people, most often the response was "That's nice, but I don't think
I'd use one". How could they not see the truth in all its glorious layer lines?!

The answer is in the concept of a 'set'[^2], and instead of trying to explain it,
I'm just going to quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(psychology)):

> In psychology, a set is a group of expectations that shape experience by making
> people especially sensitive to specific kinds of information. A perceptual set,
> also called perceptual expectancy, is a predisposition to perceive things in a
> certain way. […] A mental set is a framework for thinking about a problem.
> It can be shaped by habit or by desire. Mental sets can make it easy to solve
> a class of problem, but attachment to the wrong mental set can inhibit
> problem-solving and creativity.

This perfectly captures what happened. They'd developed a '3D printing mental set':
a predisposition to see problems that can be solved with their ~~hammer~~ 3D
printer. Once I started noticing this pattern, I started seeing it all over
the place.

### Sets at work

Aside from the "could this be improved with some 3D printed plastic" perceptual
set, I've noticed a couple of other sets: DIY, and writing puzzles.

DIY is probably the most obvious one. Once you become a little familiar with the
basics of what you can fix and how, it seems like you start noticing the
opportunities more. Before, you might have ignored that loose door handle, but
now you notice it and realise with a screwdriver and a sex bolt[^3] you can
fix it and stop it coming loose again anytime soon.

As you do more things, you build up your set of mental sets as well. You learn
how to attach things to different types of walls, how to safely work with
electricity, and so on, and suddenly installing a new outside light goes from
a seemingly complex job to just exercising some of those concepts you're already
familiar with.

This works across 'disciplines' as well: I wanted to automatically cool
a room down, using a fan in the window to blow in cool air. The 3D printing
mental set gave me a way to make it physically go where I wanted it to, the
home automation set gave me a plan for how to automate it, and the electricity
set helped me figure out how to wire in the relay. It sounds a bit stilted when
I spell it out like that, but the catch is I didn't have to sit down and work
any of this out. I was already primed to think in a certain way. I had a whole
selection of hammers, and could pick the right combination of them to beat
this particular nail[^4].

Puzzles are a bit different. I enjoy taking part in puzzle hunts[^5], and at
first I was bewildered at how the authors came up with all the puzzles. After
I started thinking about writing some myself, though, I began to notice all
kinds of things that could maybe be turned into a puzzle: a specialised
database, or a song with repetitive lyrics, or set of things with unique ID
numbers. Writing the actual puzzles is still tricky, but once you've equipped
the "look out for puzzle material" perceptual set it's much easier to gather
a range of ideas.

For example, one puzzle I wrote came about because I stumbled upon
[Sir Patrick Stewart's Cowboy Classic Sampler](https://archive.org/details/patrick-stewarts-cowboy-classic-sampler)[^6].
I think everyone will agree that it's a fairly unique collection. I tied some
samples of the songs together with some screen captures of Sir Patrick as Picard
in Star Trek: The Next Generation, and puzzlers had to find the season and
episode numbers of the pictures, then use those numbers to select a track and a
word from that track in the audio mix. Those words spell out a question, and the
answer to that question is the answer to the puzzle.

There were other hints mixed in to point you in the right direction, it wasn't
quite as opaque as it might sound! But the point is without being in that
"puzzle finding" mindset when I came across the album, there's no way I could
have come up with that puzzle. Like with the fan, I was primed to think a
certain way, and managed to create something I otherwise would have struggled
with.

### The curse of noticing things

Figuring out how to make stuff isn't the only place sets appear, though.
Perceptual sets are about how we perceive things. When you read something
with lots of bullet points, em-dashes, and the word "delve" do you automatically
think it's LLM generated?[^7] Then you have an LLM text perceptual set! It's
kind of annoying, as it's difficult to "turn off" and stop noticing these
things once you've seen them. Similarly, I think I have a "bad grammar" set.
I know it doesn't bother a lot of people, but if I'm reading a book and there's
a rogue apostrophe it will throw me right out of the moment. It's like tripping
up when walking and being torn out of a daydream. There's some use to these ---
being able to notice grammar errors easily helps with my writing --- but for
the most part they're a negative input: they point out things are broken or
bad.

The "edge case set" takes this to another level. After about 20 years of writing
software[^8] I have a finely honed ability to spot problems. Give me something to
implement and my brain will immediately rattle off all the different edge cases
and under-specified parts. Then some other bit of my brain gets the job of
deciding which we actually care about, which are worth raising, and so on.
It's definitely useful to spot them up-front, rather than when you're deep in
the weeds implementing something, and tends to make everything go a lot smoother
if you can hammer the major ones out when planning work. It doesn't turn off
after work though; it comes up when reading board game rule books, or
descriptions of the magic system in fantasy novels, or news reports, and so on.
It's a lot less useful then.

Speaking of news reports, here's a fun one: Gell-Mann amnesia is a cognitive
bias where even when you critically assess media reports about something you're
knowledgeable about (say, technology), you continue to trust similar reporting
in other areas (say, medicine). But once you know about Gell-Mann amnesia, you
might start to actively notice when it happens. You scoff at the article about
how the Internet is a "series of tubes" and then start reading the next one
about a cancer treatment, but --- wait a minute --- your Gell-Mann amnesia set
kicks in. I'm not sure what you then do with this information. Dismiss basically
all the media and news as useless? It's honestly pretty annoying.

### The meta set

I've had this blog post on my ideas list since I first noticed the "3D printing
mindset". I didn't know sets were an actual thing, and I didn't have most of
the examples I do now. As time went on with this idea rattling around in the
back of my head, I started noticing the patterns come up more and more. There's
lots of more examples I didn't include because I didn't want to just write a
listicle of mental patterns. But the fact that I noticed them all seems to mean
that I've developed a set set, or a meta-set, if you will. It's fascinating
to think about how all this happens inside our mushy bag of neurons, but
also a bit terrifying. If thought processes are that malleable, what stops you
accidentally breaking them? Actually, thinking about things like Q-Anon, flat
earthers, and a lot of contemporary "politics", maybe that's quite easy to do?

[^2]: I feel like they should have consulted the mathematicians and/or computer scientists before they picked a name.
[^3]: Yes, that's a real thing. No, I won't ever use any of the alternative names for it.
[^4]: OK, I've strained the metaphor enough. I'm sorry. I'll stop.
[^5]: If you're not familiar, a puzzle hunt is a competition where you try to solve puzzles faster than other teams. The sort of puzzles involved are perfectly described by this quote from Mike Develin: "Imagine a word search. Now imagine you aren't told what words to look for. Now imagine you aren't told it’s a word search. Now imagine it isn't a word search."
[^6]: Go and give it a listen. I'll wait.
[^7]: I hereby certify all my em-dashes are hand-crafted. Relatedly, Claude Code keeps writing comments that use hyphens when they should actually be em-dashes. Maybe they've trained it to avoid them?
[^8]: I just made myself sad by working this out. I still feel young at heart! … Or maybe that's cholesterol?
