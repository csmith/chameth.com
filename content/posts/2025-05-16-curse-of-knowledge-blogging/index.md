{%figure "right" "Photo of a sign reading \"YOUR IDEAS MATTER … Write them down :)\"" %}

The single worst part about blogging for me is trying to come up with ideas
for what to write about. Not because they're hard to come up with, but because
every idea seems too basic or not worth talking about. _Seems_.

It's not just me, either. My friends will occasionally describe some interesting
problem they've dealt with, and I'll chime in with "you should blog about that".
Almost invariably the response is something like "it's not that interesting".

There's a cognitive bias called [the curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)[^1].
Basically, once you know something you can't accurately reconstruct your previous
state of mind from when you didn't know it. You can struggle to do something
for hours, piecing together scraps of information, using all kinds of specialist
knowledge, and as soon as you're finished it all seems so _basic_ why would
anyone want to read about that?

## Other mental obstacles

Of course, nothing involving people is as simple as having one cause and an
obvious solution. Even when I get over the "it's too basic" road bump, there
are other issues. Looking back over some of my posts, I get a horrible cringe-y
feeling and the question of "why would anyone be interested in reading that?!"
arrives unbidden. Even though I know that _I'm_ interested in reading similar
posts written by other people. I'm hesitant to attach labels to everything, but
[imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) says hi.

I think there's also a cultural issue at play. British people tend to be
somewhat reserved and downplay their accomplishments, especially when compared
to people from the US[^2]. When I worked for a certain multinational
~~ad conglomerate~~ search engine company we actually had training on how to do
performance reviews and speak about ourselves more like our US counterparts.

Put all these things into a cauldron, add a lizard's leg and howlet's wing,
mix it all up, and you get a brain that despises the idea of blogging about
anything. Great.

## Dealing

So, now the problem is well-defined, what do we do about it? Clearly I am the
best person to be offering this advice, given it's been four months since my
last blog post.

The best counter to the Curse of Knowledge that I've found is keeping notes,
like a [lab notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_notebook). If you
finish something and have dozens of links to different resources that you had
to piece together, it's probably something interesting and worth talking about
even if it doesn't seem like it any more. Or maybe you didn't need a lot of
references, but you had to write a lot down to make sense of something, or
needed to draw diagrams to solve a problem. Again, probably interesting.

The other issues I've mentioned are not so easy to overcome. I'm also not going
to try and perform therapy in the form of a blog post! What I personally do is
keep a list of topics to write about (that have already passed the "probably
interesting even if my brain doesn't agree" check), and occasionally when the
stars align I'll feel like plucking one off the list and turning thoughts into
words.

## A call to action

If you've got a blog and haven't written anything recently because you "don't
do anything interesting", go write something! I promise that someone will be
interested. Hell, feel free to send me a link and _I'll_ be interested for you.

If you don't have a blog then why not start one? There are lots of great articles
out there about why-you-should and how-you-can. And as a bonus, blog posts about
how you set up your blog are _super_ interesting. That's one post sorted already!

As the open internet is slowly subsumed by massive corporate interests, and
gummed up with spam and AI slop, the voice of real humans is becoming more and
more important. Maybe we can -- one blog at a time -- get back to the '90s
internet that was full of individuality instead of today's which is full of ads
and spam?

[^1]: There's also something called "Familiarity Blindness" that people like to
talk about. It's a much better name. The only problem is that I can't find any
actual published works that talk about it. No-one authoritative defines or
mentions it. It just popped into existence a few years ago. Maybe it's an LLM
hallucination?
