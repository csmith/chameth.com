I realised the other day that it's a little over a year since I started building
out a collection of board games[^1], and thought it'd be fun to go through the
collection and what I think about the games in hindsight.

### The beginning

{% figure "right" "A picture of the board from Ticket to Ride: Europe" %}

I don't remember how I discovered the concept of "modern" boardgames, but
just over a year ago I purchased [Ticket to Ride: Europe](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14996/ticket-to-ride-europe)
as my first. Prior to that I thought board games were like Scrabble,
Monopoly, Trivial Pursuit, etc: they might provide a distraction occasionally,
but didn't amount to actual _fun_ in the same way a video game might. I'd
characterise those "classic" games as generally being extremely dependent on
luck, not presenting many interesting choices, and generally being punishing if you're behind.[^2]

Ticket to Ride came as a breath of fresh air. You get to decide where to route
your lines, whether you want to take on more cards, how aggressive to be in
blocking the other players, and more. There's still some luck involved, but
it's managed by being able to draw from a pool of visible cards, or being
able to select which route cards you keep.

<!--more-->

Shortly after I also picked up [Carcassonne](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne),
and was similarly enamoured. I've not played either of them recently, though:
they both fall into a weird little gap for me. While I enjoy the games, I don't
like playing them with certain groups[^3], but I don't love them enough to
prioritise them over other games when playing with other groups.

### Pandemic

{% figure "left" "The box of Pandemic" %}

The next "gateway" game I picked up was [Pandemic](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic),
which was my first co-operative game. I loved everything about it, and still do.
The feeling when you managed to claw back a victory after setback after setback
is great, but so is the shock when everything goes even worse than you thought
possible!

Pandemic was also the first game where one of the mechanics caught my attention.
The way epidemics work is that you take the bottom card from the infection deck,
which becomes the center of the new outbreak, then shuffle that and all the
discards back onto the top of the deck. It sounds simple, but it has big
implications: everywhere that was previously infected can now be re-infected,
and you're guaranteed some tense rounds while you work back through those
cards. It still blows my mind a little how shuffling and re-adding some card
can mix up the game so much.

I still play Pandemic when I can, and it generally has a spot in my board game
bag when I'm going away. I've since picked up the [On the Brink](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/40849/pandemic-on-the-brink)
expansion which adds some fun new twists[^4] to the base game, and
[Pandemic: Hotzone – Europe](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/329670/pandemic-hot-zone-europe)
which plays similarly but is a bit quicker and smaller. I've also recently
ordered [Iberia](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/198928/iberia), but it
hasn't materialised yet.

### More gateway games

{% figure "right" "The box of The Quacks of Quedlinburg" %}

Over the next few months I picked up [The Quacks of Quedlinburg](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244521/the-quacks-of-quedlinburg),
[Azul](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230802/azul) (the mini variant),
and [Splendor](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor). Quacks
is probably my least favourite out of all the games so far: it's not terrible,
but it straddles deck-building and push-your-luck in a way that I don't find
particularly satisfying. It's fun to play the combos you've invested in, and
it's fun to try and push your luck, but it's not really fun when failing at the
luck element means you don't get to use the stuff you were building.

Quacks does bear the distinction of being the first game I customised, though:
it got a little plastic organiser to hold all the ingredients instead of having
to sort through a massive plastic bag with them all mixed in. My appreciation
for game boxes with good built-in storage has gradually increased over the year,
as have the tools I have for fixing those that don't. But we'll get back to
that…

Azul is fun when you're in the right mood; I'm not terribly into abstract
strategy games, but Azul is light enough that it's enjoyable. Splendor, on the
other hand, I really like. So much so that I wrote a digital re-implementation
of it. Both Azul and Splendor allow you to mess with your opponent a little, but
not too much, which keeps it interesting but also means it still plays well in
groups that don't like too much head-on confrontation.[^5]

I think the thing that really caught my attention in Splendor, though, is the
quasi-engine building you do. It's not actually classed as an engine builder
on BoardGameGeek, but as you collect cards you get discounts on other cards,
which lets you get better cards and further discounts, and so on. I love that
kind of positive feedback loop in video games, and I apparently love it in
board games as well.

### Terraforming Mars

{% figure "left" "Terraforming Mars board, covered with tiles and player cubes" %}

I'd heard lots of good things about [Terraforming Mars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars),
but I was worried it sounded a bit too complicated so put off buying it for a while.
I mean, its weight on BoardGameGeek is orange. That's scary, right?! Well… no.
Terraforming Mars is easily my favourite board game, and I've played it pretty
consistently since buying it. It has such a huge stock of cards that no two
games feel the same: one game you might have an arsenal of cards that generate
and use microbes; another you might have a plethora of science tags that let
you play some of the most powerful project cards; next you might be spamming
forests on Mars, or drowning in credits because you have too much income. It
has the engine building element that I love, but I also really enjoy that it's
not always obvious who's doing well and who's not until the final score is
tallied; that keeps everyone engaged and working on things for the entire game.

I've added in the [Prelude](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/247030/terraforming-mars-prelude)
expansion, which I wouldn't play the game without now, and the [Venus Next](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/231965/terraforming-mars-venus-next)
expansion, which adds some interesting bits but is nowhere close to being a hard
requirement. I'll probably pick up [Colonies](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/255681/terraforming-mars-colonies)
next. Prelude adds a new type of card that you take at the start of the game,
which gives you a fairly hefty boost; these help you get off to a faster start,
and may also affect what strategies you try to run with for the rest of the
game. Venus Next adds another resource track, but you don't have to complete it
to end the game; it also adds a bunch of project cards that have "floater"
resources, but they don't feel that much different to the base game microbes[^6].
One interesting thing that Venus Next adds, though, is a "solar phase" where
one of the global parameters is increased at the end of each generation. The
active player decides which parameter, but gets none of the benefits for it, so
you get to decide entirely tactically.

There are two drawbacks to Terraforming Mars: it's a little lengthy, and some
of the components are a bit rubbish. Timing-wise, I find it takes a good
hour and a half for a two player game, while adding a third player can almost
double that. Obviously it depends who you're playing with and what's happening
in the game, but that's enough of a commitment that you more-or-less have to plan
when to play instead of just spontaneously bringing it to the table. Component-wise,
the game comes with basically no storage for anything other than little plastic
bags that slosh around in the box; horrible plastic cubes for resource tracking
that somehow jump out of your hand constantly, and flimsy printed sheets for
putting those cubes on.

{% figure "right" "Custom Terraforming Mars player board" %}

The reason I [got a 3D printer](/adventures-in-3d-printing/) was in part so that I could make my own upgraded
player boards that actually held the pieces in place instead of letting them fly
everywhere if the table was slightly knocked. You can buy third party ones but
I figured it was a teach-a-man-to-fish kind of situation, and dropping £200 on
a 3D printer would save me money in the long run vs buying £50 of player boards
someone else had made.[^7] About seven versions later, I have some boards which
I think look and feel great. It's 3D printed in two halves, then has a laminated
2D print sandwiched in the middle for all the markings and artwork.

As well as the player mats, I 3D printed some boxes, card holders, and
so on, but have since replaced them with an insert from [Folded Space](https://www.foldedspace.com/).
These are made of foam, and are perfectly sized to the game box and all the
components in it. I could have eventually got to that point with 3D prints, but
it would have taken a lot of time to design and print everything. Terraforming
Mars was also the game that I first sleeved, as trying to shuffle the huge decks
was an exercise in frustration. With all of the cards sleeved, not only are they
more protected against wear and tear, you can now shuffle the deck just by
gently mashing stacks of cards together. It makes shuffling so easy I now sleeve
basically all my games as I hate having to riffle shuffle unsleeved cards.

### Marrakech and HeroQuest

Later in the year I bought [Marrakech](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/29223/marrakech)
after playing a giant version of it at a games expo. It sits somewhere between
Azul and Splendor for me: it's fun, and good when you want a short game, but
it's not high enough on my list to want to take it away with me. Playing with
felt rugs does make a nice change from flipping cards or dealing with plastic
components, though.

I also picked up [HeroQuest](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/699/heroquest) at one
point when it was on offer. It's a good concept, and I felt like I would like it, but
it was a bit of a let-down. The biggest problem for me is that you either need one
player to basically be the DM, and manage the board, or you use an app to do that
and have to deal with a bunch of admin and duplicating things because you're half
playing on the board and half in the app. I also don't like relying on an
app because I've been around long enough to know how easily computer software can
become defunct, get removed from stores, get "updated" to remove features you need,
and so on. I feel like the game would work well with five
people: one to DM, and four to control the four heroes. But if you've got five people
who want to play a dungeon crawler why aren't you just playing D&D or a similar TTRPG?
I'll probably sell this at some point.

### Party games

{% figure "left" "Codenames components" %}

These are all smaller games, and with most of them I'd played them before and
decided I wanted my own copy. [Codenames](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames)
is my favourite party game, and I also picked up [Codenames: Duet](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/224037/codenames-duet)
and they now live in the same box with a nice 3D printed insert. Codenames seems
to just naturally produce fun moments: when an obscure clue is understood
completely it feels amazing, but when it's totally misunderstood it's also
generally hilarious. There's also a great tension as the spymaster when you
give a clue, then immediately realise it can be misinterpreted in a way that
points straight at the assassin.

[Poetry for Neanderthals](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/312786/poetry-for-neanderthals)
is fun in the same party-word-game sort of way, but basically has no replayability.
There are few enough cards that if you play a few times you can remember the
"harder" word and just immediately guess it once you get the "easier" one being
hinted (you can also sometimes just do this outright, which feels great but it
kind of sucks from a gameplay point of view). The best bits are the inflatable
"no stick" you get to bop people with, and how everyone speaks like a neanderthal
for a little bit out of habit even after the game has ended. I seem to be weirdly
good at this game, and I'm not sure what that says about me.

[Love Letter](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/277085/love-letter) has to
take the spot of best game per cubic centimeter. It's basically just a small
set of cards, but it enables some really fun emergent gameplay. I really love
how small the game is, and how easy it is to set up and play. It's the perfect
time filler. I've also played [Lovecraft Letter](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/198740/lovecraft-letter),
which adds a lot more complexity and was great fun, but is sadly out of print
and I haven't been able to find a copy at a sensible price.

### Fluxx

{% figure "right" "A game of Star Trek mega-Fluxx, with three transporter cards in play" %}

My arbitrary 12 month period ends not long after I went to a tabletop event
and played, amongst other things, [Cthulu Fluxx](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/122159/cthulhu-fluxx),
[Doctor Who Fluxx](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/235365/doctor-who-fluxx), and
[Star Trek: The Next Generation Fluxx](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/246530/star-trek-the-next-generation-fluxx).
Each game has the same core Fluxx elements, but adds slight twists along with
the unique themes. I ordered a copy of [Star Fluxx](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/102104/star-fluxx),
but then found out that you can combine the four Star Trek variants (TOS, TNG, DS9 and VOY) together
with some expansions to make a mega game so ordered all of those as well. While
putting together my mega-Fluxx order I noticed they had a [Firefly Fluxx](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/183896/firefly-fluxx)
that was out of print so I snapped up one of the last copies of that, too.

I ordered most of the games direct from Looney Labs, as the out of print ones
weren't readily available anywhere else. Unfortunately, UK Border Force managed
to misread the import label[^8] and demanded £300 of VAT and import duties on
them! They refunded it eventually, but this small set of tiny games were for
a little while the most expensive things in my collection.

Fluxx is fun enough, but the mega-deck version is brilliant. It gets much more
chaotic, with multiple captains, teleporters, and other doodads in play to steal
cards back and forth. I was worried it wouldn't play well with non-Trekkies, but
the cards from each series use a different font and the weird people that can't
identify Star Trek series based on uniform variations seem happy enough relying
on that.

### Future

A few more months have passed since then, and my collection is still growing.
Board game stores have summer sales, it turns out! If my physical wallet was
in any way involved in the purchasing flow I'm sure it'd be crying.

I've recently started logging my plays with [BG Stats](https://www.bgstatsapp.com/)
(which synchronises the information up to Board Game Geek). I'm interested to
see if the hard numbers actually align with my conceptions of how often I play
certain games. If I do another roundup in a year's time, expect it to have a
lot more stats in…

[^1]: Other words that may be appropriate here: "hoarding";
"compulsively obtaining"; "spending all my money on", etc

[^2]: Think about a game of Monopoly: what do you actually get to decide? It
basically comes down to "buy or not" if you land on an available property, then
later on "buy more houses or not".

[^3]: e.g. a family member doesn't like the farmer mechanic in Carcassonne, and
I don't find the game interesting enough without them. Nothing wrong with the
game or the people, we're just not going to both enjoy it the way we like when
playing together.

[^4]: Which is definitely why I bought it. Not because it comes with amazing
little petri dishes to keep the disease cubes in. Certainly not.

[^5]: There's a different edge to taking a card that someone else wanted in
Splendor --- there's twelve others they can pick from, or they can take a face
down one, etc; it might be an inconvenience but you haven't totally upended
their plans --- versus blocking a really long train line they were trying to
build in Ticket to Ride.

[^6]: Floaters are meant to be big pieces of infrastructure that float in the
atmosphere of Venus. The fact that they feel exactly the same way as tiny little
microbes when played seems wrong.

[^7]: Having since bought a more expensive printer, I think I'm past the point
of convincing myself it's "cheaper". It's a lot more fun, though, and if you
design parts yourself you end up with exactly what you want!

[^8]: Turns out the "weight (lbs)" column is not the "quantity" column. Who knew?
