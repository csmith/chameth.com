Recently I realised that I've developed a self-imposed quality bar for blog
posts. They need to be a certain length, and have a certain _substance_ to them.
They need to be generally useful in some way I can't quite define, to some
imagined future audience. They need to have images to break up the page, and
opengraph data for when they're linked to on social media. Butâ€¦ maybe they
don't? Those things all make sense for longer "article" type posts, but not so
much for a personal blog.

I've done some fiddling so that I can make posts without all that extra stuff.
We'll see how it goes. The posts won't be distinguished on the site (yet?), but
I have set up separate RSS feeds for just [short form posts](/short.xml) and
[long form posts](/long.xml) in case subscribers are radically opposed to one
or the other. Now I can start blogging like it's 2005 again. But hopefully
with a bit less cringe.

I've been staring at this post in my editor for about five minutes. The urge
to make it longer, more thorough, more article-like is really strong. This
entire paragraph is only here as a compromise with myself so I can actually
save and commit the post.
