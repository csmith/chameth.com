I wrote before about how I'd [dropped Spotify in favour of locally stored music](/escaping-spotify-the-hard-way/),
but things have advanced a bit since. I had a few issues: Tauon would
occasionally manage to lose its database and along with it all my carefully
constructed playlists and song ratings[^1], and the experience on my phone was
not very fun.

I had to manually sync the music by plugging my phone in to the
computer, and sometimes it just refused to mount the right partition. I don't
think there's really a good way to debug an Apple phone not behaving properly
when connected to a Linux desktop. Then I started wanting more than one playlist
synced[^2], and trying to find a way to make that work just broke me.

I spent a while looking at different ways of hosting the music centrally.
[Plexamp](https://www.plex.tv/en-gb/plexamp/) gets lots of good reviews, and
I've used Plex a fair bit. I set about spinning up a Plex server, and just
could not get it working. The server ran fine, served the web interface, but
would neither associate with my account nor run standalone. The docs were
contradictory and there was very little useful logging. After a lot of
frustration, I stumbled across mentions that
[Plex block running on Hetzner](https://lowendbox.com/blog/plex-blocks-hetzner-in-move-against-piracy/).
I assume that's the cause of my issues, although I have no way to know for sure.
I use Hetzner for all my servers and other hosted services, but Plex have
decided I can't run the self-hosted software that I have a lifetime subscription
for there. What the actual fuck?

I could have probably worked around the arbitrary restriction, but I didn't
want to throw more time down the drain. Instead, I set up
[Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/), an open source music server. It
supports the Subsonic protocol, which means you can use a whole slew of
different clients with it (or even write your own). It also means there's a
nice way to get data in and out of it programmatically, which I recall being
a bit of a fight with Plex.

### Syncing and organising

All my music lived on my desktop, but now I wanted it on my server. At first
I just used `rsync` to copy everything up. I'd maintain a local "master" copy,
and periodically shove the changes to the server[^3]. That quickly got old,
so I set up [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to keep the two folders in
sync. That workedâ€¦ for a while.

Concurrently, I was looking at improving the organisation of my music. It
was mostly organised by some Go programs I'd thrown together to automate the
importing, with no real validation of metadata or anything else. Some albums
got split up into multiple folders because the tracks had different artists
(and didn't have an album artist set); some artists ended up with multiple
folders with slight spelling or case variations. It was upsetting.

I'd used [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/) before to fix
some issues, but I didn't really like the UI, especially when trying to do
bulk actions. The main alternative is [beets](https://beets.io/), which
describes itself as "the music geek's media organiser", and is entirely
command line. I was intrigued.

I started playing around with beets, and quickly noticed a problem. Every time
I changed a metadata tag in a music file, Syncthing had to upload the entire
file. I was frequently changing tags across the whole library as I got beets
set up how I wanted, and Syncthing was handling it by uploading gigabytes of
files for every minor change. I was already a bit unhappy with having the
content duplicated in two places, so now I was using a command line organiser
I figured I could just get rid of my local copy and move everything to the
server.

I set up a Docker container for beets, and then wrote some incredibly hacky
shell scripts so I could run `beet` locally on my desktop and it would SSH
to the server over Tailscale and exec into the container, passing the arguments
along. Then I did one final sync of the music library, got rid of Syncthing,
double checked I had a backup and deleted all of my local music.

### Bears, Beets, Battlestar Galactica

Beets is amazing. It has a vast array of plugins that can do almost anything
you could want with a music library, and the command line workflow works really
well for me. It's very well documented, and all the individual parts are
pleasingly simple and easy to understand.

Here's what it looks like when importing some new music:

{% figure "full" "Screenshot of beets output when importing an album. It shows the source folder in blue, the matched metadata information in white with green highlights, the MusicBrainz URL, then a listing of all tracks" %}

If it doesn't get a perfect match then it shows the closest matches, and
summarises what's different about them (missing tracks, different names,
etc), and lets you decide what to do. Aside from the metadata matching, it's
doing a lot of things under the hood that aren't necessarily apparent. It:

- Looks up the genre from Last.fm
- Analyses all the tracks and writes ReplayGain metadata to them
- Fetches album art
- Checks all the files to make sure they're actually playable
- Scrubs any existing metadata tags

It also maintains its own database, and you can query against it. The query
language is both simple and quite powerful, like the rest of beets. As an
example:

```shell
$ beet ls artist:"Linkin Park" year:2025 length:2:00..2:30 
Linkin Park - From Zero - Casualty
```

Almost all the other commands also let you use the query syntax, which makes
the whole tool really powerful. Want to delete all country tracks that you
added last month? No problem. Redownload all the album art for a certain
band? Easy. You can even do smart playlists using the filters.

### Actually playing music

With all this organisation, I've not actually mentioned one tiny detail: how
I actually play music now. Navidrome has a web UI, which is perfectly usable,
but I don't really want my web browser involved as it makes balancing sound
levels tricky, and getting media keys working is a pain. Thankfully there
are loads of Subsonic clients. I've tried several, but eventually settled on
[Feishin](https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin) on the desktop. It's very pretty:

{% figure "full" "A screenshot of Feishin. On the left side of the screen is the album art (Love, Drugs & Misery by Eva Under Fire), with the track, album, artist, year and file format below it. On the right hand side is a tabbed panel, currently showing 'Up Next' which shows a queue of music. At the bottom is a standard player interface with play/pause/skip/etc buttons." %}

What attracted me to it, though, was its built-in support for Navidrome's smart
playlists. These aren't even properly exposed in Navidrome's web UI yet, but
Feishin has a visual editor that lets you create and edit them. I ended up with
an identical system to the playlists I had in Tauon: a "blacklist" playlist
which are tracks I never want to play, a "favourites" playlist, and then an
"everything" playlist which is the entire catalogue minus the blacklist.

On iOS I've settled on [Arpeggi](https://www.reddit.com/r/arpeggiApp/). It's
not actually on the App Store yet, but available via TestFlight. It's one of
those really nicely polished apps that are obviously a labour of love, not just
out to do the minimum possible to get your money. It can cache songs offline,
and automatically download entire playlists, and supports all of the standard
Subsonic features like rating, reporting plays back to the server, and so on.

One unexpected benefit of using a central server is that it handles reporting
plays to [Last.fm](https://last.fm/) and [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/)
instead of the clients. I don't think I've ever bothered to configure my mobile
clients to do that before, and now it just works automagically. I'm relying on
those services more for recommendations and discovery, as that's something you
lose out on when self-hosting.

### Making bad decisions about bitrates

With all the moving, copying, and organising, I started thinking about how
large the collection was. The songs were all in different formats, depending
on when and where I'd picked them up, and I couldn't tell the difference
between them. I did a test and transcoded an MP3 file down to 128kbps, and
still couldn't tell the difference. So armed with that sample size of 1, I
transcoded the entire library and saved *so much* space.

I don't remember which track I did that first test with, but it must have
been a very unlucky pick. I quickly started to notice the distortions caused
by the low bitrate. It was particularly bad in any song with a lot of treble,
and started to really annoy me. I started a painful process of reimporting
things in their original format. Beets came in clutch again, both with the
import process (if you import a duplicate album, it asks if you want to
replace the original, and shows the format and bitrate of them for comparison),
and keeping track of what was left to fix (`beet ls bitrate:..128000`).

Having started paying more attention to the sound quality, I think I've been
nibbled on by the audiophile bug. I've been trying to get new music in FLAC
format where possible. I'm pretty sure I _can't_ tell the difference between
a decent bitrate MP3 and a FLAC, but maybe if I got a better DAC and some nice
headphonesâ€¦? Someone please hide my credit card!

As for the library taking up a lot of space, I now realise it's a price worth
paying. I might need to swap out the server to one with more storage at some
point in the future, but it's generally worth upgrading every few years with
rented dedicated servers anyway, as you often get more for the same amount of
money. Next upgrade I'll just make sure there's an appropriately-sized disk
instead of focusing entirely on RAM and CPU.

### Writing more code

Naturally, this whole process spawned several side projects. When browsing
albums in Navidrome, I was a bit upset that the album art wasn't all a
consistent size. I thought about scripting something to crop them consistently,
but then I had a better idea, and [jewelcase](https://github.com/csmith/jewelcase)
was born. It takes the album art, crops it down to a consistent size, and then
renders it inside a jewel case. It applies some slight effects, like adjusting
the colours, rounding the corners, and tweaking the edges so it looks a bit more
real. I don't know why[^4], but every time I see the effect it gives me a little
spark of joy.

{% figure "full" "A comparison screenshot. On the left are four albums, with their unaltered artwork. Some are different aspect ratios. On the right are the same four albums, but the art work is now consistently rendered as though its in a jewel case." %}

The other project is [BASS](https://github.com/csmith/bass), a tool that uses
the Subsonic API to grab information about my music catalogue, and then
generates a "Daily Mix" playlist. It uses a system of weights to select tracks
semi-randomly, biasing towards favourite tracks, those that haven't been played
much, and a few other criteria. This gives me a nice balance between having my
favourites on repeat, and exploring the full library at random.

All the weights in BASS are customisable, so I can tweak it to my heart's
desire, and anyone else can also run it and configure it entirely differently
to me if they want to. I can't imagine I would've been able to do that if I were
using Plex!

[^1]: I was running a version from git as the stable release had fun dependency
issues on Arch, so it's possible this wouldn't be an issue in normal use. I also
started backing up the database, but it's still annoying to have to restore it.
[^2]: A "favourites" playlist for me, and a more "family friendly" playlist
for when I'm playing music out loud that has a bit less screaming/swearing/etc.
[^3]: One of the reasons for starting this was being annoyed by the periodic
sync to my phone, obviously it makes perfect sense to introduce a new, different
periodic sync.
[^4]: Nostalgia? A little bit of OCD? Both?
