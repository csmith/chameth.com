## Things I Use

In the vein of [uses this](https://usesthis.com/) and following on from my
post about [how I get things done](/how-i-get-things-done/), this is a
list of things I use that I'll try to keep up-to-date.

Last updated: 5th April 2025

### Computer hardware

I built a new PC in March 2025. I use it for both work and gaming. It travels
with me to LAN events, so it's as small as I can make it. The build is:

| Component    | Product                                                                                         | Specs                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Case         | [Fractal Design Terra](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/terra/terra/terra-silver/) | Silver                            |
| Processor    | AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D                                                                             | 8-core, 104MB cache, up to 5.2GHz |
| Cooler       | Thermalright AXP90 X47 Full                                                                     |                                   |
| Graphics     | Gigabyte Radeon RX 9070XT                                                                       | PCI-E 5, 16GB GDDR6, 3060MHz      |
| Memory       | Corsair Vengeance                                                                               | 64GB, 6600MHz, CL32               |
| Storage      | Crucial T705 NVMe SSD                                                                           | 2TB, Gen 5                        |
| Motherboard  | Gigabyte B850I Aorus Pro                                                                        |                                   |
| Power supply | Cooler Master V750 SFX                                                                          | Fully modular                     |

{% figure "right" "Fractal Design Terra Case" %}

Previously I was using a Dell G15 Special Edition laptop, with an NVIDIA GeForce
RTX 3060. This was handy while I was travelling more, but the 3060 was
struggling and the inability to upgrade the major components was annoying.

This is the first computer I've ever built with an AMD processor and graphics
cards. All my old ones have been Intel and NVIDIA builds, but it feels like both
companies have made major missteps recently while AMD is doing very good things.

Despite the small form factor, the build was straight forward. The Terra
is a nicely designed case, providing lots of access that make up for the tiny
volume you have to work in.

Along with the PC, I use:

- [Alienware AW3423DWF](https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/alienware-34-curved-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw3423dwf/apd/210-bfrq/monitors-monitor-accessories) 34-inch QD-OLED monitor
- [Melifo curved light bar](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09FHMPFW1/)
- Logitech Brio webcam
- [Durgod K320 keyboard](https://www.durgod.com/product/k320-space-gray/)
  - One with Cherry MX Silent Red switches for not annoying people
  - One with Cherry MX Blues for good typing experiences
- [Zowie EC1-C wired mouse](https://zowie.benq.eu/en-uk/mouse/ec1-c.html)
- [HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless headset](https://uk.hyperx.com/products/hyperx-cloud-alpha-wireless)
- [Secretlab TITAN Evo 2022 Series chair](https://secretlab.co.uk/products/titan-evo-2022-series)
- [Nanuk 935 hard case](https://nanuk.com/products/nanuk-935) for transport

{% figure "right" "Alienware AW3423DWF monitor" %}

The Alienware monitor is _gorgeous_. QD-OLED is an amazing display technology
and just makes everything pop. I went to a LAN event where someone had one of
these monitors and within weeks four of us had purchased our own.

The Cloud Alpha Wireless headphones have an amazing battery life. We're talking
weeks of near constant use. Whoever optimised the power draw on them to get such
a good battery life should get a medal.

The Nanuk case makes it easy to cart a PC around with me (as opposed to a
laptop that just goes into a backpack). It fits the PC, keyboard, mouse, headset
and cables. I'm hoping to get a slim monitor that will fit as well, so it can
provide a complete LAN setup in one box. Nanuk provide full 3D models for all
their cases, which is great if you might want to 3D print things to fit in them.

### Other hardware

- iPhone 15 Pro
- iPad 10th generation
- [Xiaomi Smart Band 7](https://www.mi.com/uk/product/xiaomi-smart-band-7/) for tracking and alarms
- [Kindle Paperwhite signature edition](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08N2QK2TG/) for reading

I don't really like Apple's walled garden, but [as I've written before](/apple-google-aligned-incentives/)
I'd rather go with the company that makes money by producing shiny phones, than
the company that makes money by shoving adverts down my throat.

I would've gone with an older iPad, but the 10th gen was the first with a real
USB connector instead of lightning.

### Software and services

#### General

{% figure "right" "The Arch Linux logo" %}

- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) on the desktop
- [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com) for e-mail, calendar and contacts
- [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/) for task tracking

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) for web browsing
  - [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) for ad blocking/privacy
  - [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) for overriding stylesheets
- [Kagi](https://kagi.com/) for web search
- [You Need A Budget](https://www.ynab.com/) for budgeting
- [FreeAgent](https://www.freeagent.com/) for work accounts
- [Tauon](https://tauonmusicbox.rocks/) for playing music
  - [Last.fm](https://last.fm/) for tracking plays and recommendations
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) for passwords
- [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/) for IRC
  - [Soju](https://soju.im/) as a bouncer
  - [Ergo](https://ergo.chat/about) for an internal ircd
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) for voice chat and people who don't use IRC
- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app) for social media-y things
- [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) for feed reading

I prefer self-hosted and open source where possible for services, but there's
a lot of cases where that's not feasible for one reason or another.

#### Making things

- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) for image editing
- [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) for video editing
- [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/en/) for CAD
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) for occasional  pixel editing
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for occasional vector editing
- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) for some rare digital drawing

#### Development and sysadmin-y things

{% img "Screenshot of IntelliJ IDEA while editing this page" %}

- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) for intra-machine communication
- [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/) for DNS (and a load of ad blocking)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for basically all code editing
  - [Darcula Darker](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12692-darcula-darker-theme) theme
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for lighter text editing
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) terminal emulator
  - [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) shell
  - [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) for configuration
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) for git hosting, CI, issues, etc
- [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) for dedicated servers, VPSs, and some "cloud" things
- [Restic](https://restic.net/) for backups
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) for static websites (including this one!)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) if I can't avoid client-side JavaScript
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for running anything on servers
  - [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for configuring/orchestrating

This list could probably go on forever. I'll refrain from listing programming
languages, libraries, frameworks, etc.

#### Games

{% figure "right" "Allplay board game bag, in blue" %}

- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) for video games
- [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) for storing data and talking about board games
- [Board Game Arena](https://boardgamearena.com/) for playing board games online
- [Board Game Stats](https://www.bgstatsapp.com/) for recording plays and other information

I won't really bother with video games on other platforms, aside from the occasional
free-standing MMORPG. Steam works amazingly on Linux, is generally not
user-hostile like a lot of other places, and Valve have done great things
for making games actually work.

### Tools

  - [Hex-plus allen key set](https://products.wera.de/en/new_products_2024_l-keys_950_9_hex-plus_multicolour_3.html) for dealing with hexagons
- [Knipex Cobra pliers](https://www.knipex.com/en-uk/products/pipe-wrenches-and-water-pump-pliers/knipex-cobra-high-tech-water-pump-pliers/knipex-cobra-high-tech-water-pump-pliers/8701125)

My preference for tools is basically Makita for power tools (both because
they're good and to keep a consistent battery system), Wera for anything
screwdriver adjacent, Engineer for anything delicate, and Knipex for anything
that falls through the gaps.
