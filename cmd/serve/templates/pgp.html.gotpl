<h2>PGP information</h2>
<p>
    This page used to list my PGP key fingerprint and other information. In the years it was listed, Iâ€™ve received
    exactly no benefit from publishing it, and a moderate amount of inconvenience.
</p>
<p>
    If you need to send me something securely then <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>, and we can mutually agree
    on one of the many modern communication platforms with good security and privacy guarantees.
