    As a general rule, I won't answer individual requests for help â€” if you need help with something I'd recommend
    describing the problem in a relevant public forum such as Stack Overflow or a language/tech-specific
    subreddit. That way you get access to lots of potential people who may be able to help, and the response is
    available publicly for anyone else with the same issue in the future.
