Me:
  looking forward to a nice lie in

The rest of the household:
  banging and clanging and
  screaming and shouting;
  it's a home-baked reveille
  just like mum used to make.

It occurs to me that a lot of my poems are about sleeping. I
guess it's a fairly easy target. This was mainly built around
the "banging and clanging and screaming and shouting" part,
which has a nice rhythm. The "home-baked reveille" came later,
but the mish-mash of imagery it conjures amuses me a lot.
