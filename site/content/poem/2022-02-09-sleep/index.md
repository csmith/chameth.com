slug: sleep

<pre>
Sleep: that sublime state, placid and serene,
when problems of the day proceed away:
day's dreary difficulties dropped dead,
forgot, replaced with legion fantasies.

But why is it that sleep, so essential,
is also stubborn, unobtainable?
Instead of falling off for forty winks,
you lie awake and in your head instead
those dreary daytime difficulties swell,
and multiply and maim and magnify.

Then, as if that was not enough: some more.
Clock watching. Meta-worries. Fight or flight.
Each second twists and lengthens into years,
while primate brain prepares to wage a war;
but finances and work aren't predators,
long-past mistakes and social errs not threats.

At times, for reasons unexplainable,
sleep comes: the problems fade; normalcy reigns.
And sometimes the circadian gods smile,
sleep happens orderly each day for weeks.
But the good times, too, have dark undertows:
insomnia is lurking in the west,
a-waiting, seeking to retake her throne.
Perhaps she can be banished utterly?
If you know: answers on a postcard, please.
