title: Sleep
slug: sleep

<pre>
Sleep â€” that sublime and delectable state,
when the problems of the day go away:
dreary daytime difficulties dropped
in favour of idyllic fantasies.

But why is it that sleep, so essential,
can be stubbornly unprocurable?
Instead of falling off for forty winks,
you lie awake and in your head instead
those dreary daytime difficulties swell,
and multiply and magnify and maim.
A suffocating, encompassing cloud
of dread, despair, despondency and doom.

Then, as if that wasn't enough: some more.
Meta-worries. Clock watching. Fight or flight.
Second to second feels like year to year,
while the primate inside prepares to fight.
But work and finances aren't predators,
past mistakes and social errs are not threats.

Sometimes, for reasons unexplainable,
sleep comes: the problems fade; normalcy reigns.
Sometimes the circadian gods smile,
and sleep happens on time each day for weeks.
But the good times, too, have dark undertows:
insomnia lurking in the distance,
ready, waiting, poised to retake her throne.
Maybe she can be banished completely?
If you know how: answers on a postcard,
please.
